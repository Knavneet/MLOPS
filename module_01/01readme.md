# Welcome to Our New Course on MLOps!

Hello everyone, and welcome to our exciting new course focused on putting machine learning into production. In this course, we will delve into the world of MLOpsâ€”what it is, why it matters, and how to implement it effectively.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps, short for Machine Learning Operations, is a set of best practices designed to deploy and maintain machine learning models in production reliably and efficiently. If you search "MLOps" on your favorite search engine, you'll likely come across a comprehensive Wikipedia page. There, you'll find that MLOps involves a combination of tools and practices that streamline the integration of machine learning models into real-world applications.

## Course Focus

Throughout this course, we will cover these best practices and explore the tools necessary to implement them. We'll guide you through the entire process using a practical example: predicting the duration of a taxi ride.

### Course Example: Predicting Taxi Ride Duration

Imagine you need to hire a taxi. You open your app, input your current location and your desired destination, and you want to know how long the trip will take. This prediction task will be our case study throughout the course.

## Best Practices in MLOps

To understand MLOps, it's essential to break down the machine learning project process into three main stages:

### 1. Design

In the design stage, we assess whether machine learning is the right tool for solving our problem. For instance, when predicting the duration of a taxi ride, we first evaluate if machine learning is necessary or if a simpler solution exists. If we determine that machine learning is the best approach, we move to the next stage.

### 2. Train

During the training stage, we develop our machine learning model. This involves conducting numerous experiments to identify the most effective model. The output of this stage is a trained model ready for deployment.

### 3. Operate

The final stage is operation, where we deploy the model to a production environment. In our taxi ride example, this means integrating the model into a web service via an API. When a user inputs their pickup and drop-off locations, our API predicts the trip duration, such as "approximately 10 minutes."

## Ensuring Model Performance

Deployment is not the end of the journey. Once the model is live, we need to monitor its performance to ensure it continues to provide accurate predictions and doesn't degrade over time. MLOps practices help us automate these tasks, making it easier to retrain models, deploy updates, and monitor quality.

## Next Steps

In the next video, we'll prepare the environment for our course. I'll demonstrate how to set up a virtual machine, though using a cloud-based computer is optional. We'll cover the steps to create a virtual environment for our machine learning projects.

Stay tuned, and I'll see you soon as we dive deeper into the world of MLOps!
