- **Introduction**: Alexey talks about how to use GitHub Codespaces as an alternative to renting a virtual machine on the cloud.
- **Benefits**: Codespaces is simpler and faster, allowing more coverage in a shorter time.
- **Requirements**: Need a GitHub account.
- **Creating Repository**:
  - Go to GitHub account.
  - Click on "New repository".
  - Name it (e.g., mlopsZoomCamp).
  - Add README file and .gitignore template for Python.
  - Set the repository to the public for homework submission.
- **Setting Up Codespaces**:
  - Click on "Code" and select the Codespaces tab.
  - Click "Create codespace on Main".
  - Environment is prepared with Visual Studio Code running in the browser.
  - Docker and Docker Compose are pre-installed.
- **Terminal Usage**:
  - Use terminal in Codespaces to run commands.
  - Docker is configured (run `docker run hello-world`).
- **Local VS Code Setup**:
  - For port forwarding and running certain applications like Jupyter Notebooks, use Visual Studio Code desktop.
  - Install Visual Studio Code desktop and the GitHub Codespaces extension.
- **Connecting to Codespaces from Local VS Code**:
  - Open the repository in local VS Code.
  - Ensure GitHub Codespaces extension is installed.
- **Editing and Committing Changes**:
  - Open terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + ~).
  - Make changes to files (e.g., README).
  - Commit and push changes to GitHub.
- **Installing Conda**:
  - Download and install Anaconda using a provided command.
  - Accept license agreement and default installation path.
  - Initialize Anaconda in the terminal.
- **Using Anaconda**:
  - Open a new terminal window to use the installed Python from Anaconda.
  - Verify Anaconda Python installation.
- **Setting Up Jupyter Notebook**:
  - Create a directory for the course (e.g., `mkdir Z1-intro`).
  - Start Jupyter Notebook (`jupyter notebook`).
  - Port forwarding in Codespaces allows accessing Jupyter from the local browser.
- **Running Jupyter Notebook**:
  - Open the forwarded port link in the browser.
  - Create a new notebook for homework.
- **Working with Data**:
  - Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas).
  - Install additional libraries if needed (e.g., `pip install pyarrow`).
  - Load and process data files (e.g., parquet files).
- **Committing Homework**:
  - Use Git commands to add, commit, and push homework solutions.
  - Verify changes on GitHub.
- **Stopping Codespaces**:
  - Codespaces can detect inactivity and stop automatically.
  - Manually stop Codespaces if needed from the GitHub interface.
  - Preserve uncommitted changes or delete the Codespace to remove configurations.
- **Codespaces Pricing**:
  - Free up to 120 hours, with additional hours available for purchase if needed.
- **Course Configuration**:
  - Configure AWS and other tools similarly as on a local instance.
  - Install necessary packages for course modules.
